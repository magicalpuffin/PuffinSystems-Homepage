Recently I decied to waste an excessive amount of money on a new mechanical keyboard. I was interested in ergonomic split keyboard designs and ended up buying the Moonlander MKI from ZSA.

I planed on continuing to use the standard QWERTY layout despite its flaws primarily because it would be easier to learn. There were also other reasons such as:

- Preserving the ability to use other keyboards such as ones on laptops
- Keeping the default keybindings and righthand home row when using Vim
- Using the bumps on the "f" and "j" keys for find the home row

Despite still using the layout I was used to, the ortholinear design was enough to throw off my typing. This was almost entirely due to the bad typing habits I had; this gets punished far more severly when using a split ortholinear design. Some bad habbits include:

- Trying to pressing the "b" key with the right hand
- Pressing "b" instead of "v"
- Using the middle finger for "u" instead of the index
- Pressing "x" with the middle finger instead of the ring
- Pressing "c" with the index finger instead of the middle
